### Models set for the methodological approach:
Notebooks `08-SMA-statistical-models.ipynb`and `09,10-SMA.ipynb` compute several models outlined for day-ahead spot electricity price predictions:
- Baseline AR(1)
- ARIMA(5,1,3); consistent improvement across all plants over baseline
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN):
    - T2V layering
    - Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM)
    - Gated-Recurrent Unit (GRU)

Size of model files (in `.pkl`) format are quite big to push onto GitHub repositories, thus, find these at this public drive location: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ctf7_ejQpSDhqWhhx9cFWSTgGdlY148n?usp=sharing
